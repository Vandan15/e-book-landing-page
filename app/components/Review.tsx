        "I am a stock advisor. To run my business, I need a huge & consistent flow of high-quality leads who can work with me. I was running ads on Facebook and Instagram but getting leads who didnâ€™t have much budget to invest. I needed high-budget clients but was unable to get them. I purchased this e-book after seeing an ad on Instagram. I read every chapter carefully and followed the suggestions to target high-budget clients. Today, I only work with clients having a high budget to invest.",

        "I am a nutrition consultant. I guide people to get in shape before their marriage. My business wants lots of leads who can take our demo sessions and then apply for a 2-month course. Since I run ads in specific areas, I was getting lots of duplicate leads also leads were not of buying intent. After reading this book, I got to know what mistakes I am making. I sent this e-book to a person who was running my ads. He implemented the things and I started getting high-quality leads with high-converting intent.",
